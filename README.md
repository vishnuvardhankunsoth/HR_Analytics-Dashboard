My work:
1.	Learned how to create a dashboard using Power BI that can be used for HR Analytics.
2.	Started by the process of importing data into Power BI, and made transformations. 
3.	Then created various bar charts, pie charts, cards and slicers for visualizations.
4.	Added filters to the dashboard for customized visualizations. 
5.	The created dashboard will include charts and graphs that show attrition by education.
6.	Attrition by age, salary slab, job role, years at the company, gender, and rate.
7.	Also shows a count of the employees, average age, salary, and years.
8.	By the end I learned how to use Power BI for business analysis and gained valuable skills.
